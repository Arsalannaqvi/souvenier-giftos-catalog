# Staged Updates

Workflow: when a preview is approved ("I like it"), it's logged under **Pending**
below instead of shipping right away. Pending updates sit here, implemented but
not live — work keeps moving to the next idea. Saying "make it live" (or similar)
implements and pushes everything in **Pending** in one batch; each item then
moves down into **Shipped** with its commit hash and ship date.

Ask "how many pending" any time for a quick count.

## Pending (0)

_Nothing staged yet._

## Shipped

- **2026-10-09** — Bulk quotation builder — adds Branding (logo engraving /
  screen print / embroidery / no branding), delivery city, needed-by date,
  recipient count, and budget-per-recipient (indicative, labelled as such) to
  the shortlist form; sending now goes through a Review screen first
  (Edit / Confirm) before opening WhatsApp with a fully itemized, structured
  message instead of the old loose list — `bed33740`
- **2026-10-09** — Brand slider on the homepage, fixed — the "Brand" quick-row's
  flat text chips are now compact tiles (monogram badge + name), sized so 5
  are visible at once on a phone screen with a 6th peeking at the edge; a
  follow-up fix made every brand name render in full (no ellipsis, no
  mid-word breaks). Same underlying `selectBrand()`/filter logic, just
  restyled — `fc6284d9`, `30c65709`
- **2026-10-09** — Dark navy / electric-blue / violet "futuristic luxury" rebrand
  (hero/welcome-screen glow, gradient CTAs and price text, Space Grotesk +
  Inter typography, gradient size-picker pills) — `8116747a`
  _(shipped immediately, before this staging workflow was set up)_
